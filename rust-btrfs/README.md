## Description

This is a (somewhat incomplete) rust reimplementation of the rust userspace
library. In fact, there isn't a C userspace library as such, but the userspace
tools include lowlevel interfaces which this project is based on.

This is mostly here to implement the things I need for now, but I'm open to any
contributions to make this the standard BTRFS userspace library for rust!

## Supported features

This library consists of a number of wrappers around the BTRFS ioctls.

- Deduplication (not BTRFS specific)
- Fiemap (file extent map, not BTRFS specific)
- File system info
- Space and device info
